All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Unfortunately, I did not get to see the staff solution.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: This may sound very simple but I am proud of the minusOne and plusOne methods for the circular array structure which uses the modulo function (%) to keep 
   the final number within the size of the array. The resize method was particularly challenging because of the four special cases and took extra time to
   figure out. Completing that was probably the most rewarding part of the project. I used a couple of private helper methods getFirst and getLast to be clearer
   to the reader. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Having the four special cases for the resize method makes the cody somewhat bulky/verbose. Other than that section, the remaining parts of the program seem
   compact and clean.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I did not get to speak with a partner about my program.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I would have known about taking the time to comprehensively review all possibilities/special cases before jumping in to write the code and do
   a change-and-pray essentially. Writing the different scenarios on paper help visualize the coding approach and break the big problem into more manageable
   pieces. Knowing how to use the modulo function cleverly will also help accelerate my completion time. I learned about this technique by consulting a friend.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Given what I know now, I will write it in a similar way. I may change the approach after completing this course and learning more advanced techniques.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Unfortunately, I did not get to see the staff solution.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I am proud that the code passed the extensive Gradescope tests even after numerous multiple submits. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: For the removeFirst and removeLast methods, i ended up using a double .next.next and .prev.prev calls which seem somewhat risky but the circular implementation of
   the DLList is brilliant that code will not run into a null error issue.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: I did not get to discuss my code with another student. 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I appreciate that Josh introduced the concept of circular linked list which made the solution very elegant. 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A:
